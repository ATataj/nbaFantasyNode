# nbaFantasyNode
a rough Node.js backend for an nba fantasy ai system

Initially, this will form the basis of a web scrape backend of nba.com data using an nba api library.

As the project progresses, it will serve as a k8s backend node stitching together a react frontend one, a mysql db one, and some pandas/python machine learning one(s) serving appropriate nba data in various forms.
