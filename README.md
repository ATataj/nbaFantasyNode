# nbaFantasyNode
a rough Node.js backend for an nba fantasy ai system

Initially, this will form the basis of a web scrape backend of nba.com data using npm nba api libraries.
As the project progresses, it will serve as a k8s back end node between a react frontend one, a mysql db one, and a pandas/python machine learning one(s) serving nba data in various forms.
